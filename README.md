# Hummingbird Guitars mock E-Commerce Site

Hummingbird Guitars E-commerce project is a work to show the workings of ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL, and Bootstrap together. The site includes several different cool features such as:  

-An automatic image slider using React's Class component state on the home page. 

-A product page loading data from a MySQL database and filtering from the backend with SQL queries. 

-A contact page that saves the submited form information into a MySQL database and then loads the information into a comment section.

-A Node Express server to handle communication with the database and define the endpoints to send data to the react page.


All the pages are made to be responsive from computer screens to small mobile screens. This is made possible with both bootstrap and media queries.

## Getting Started

When starting the project execute 

```bash
npm install
```

in the main project folder. This will install the dependencies from both the main package.json as well as the client folder's package.json thanks to a script in the main folders package.json.

If you would like to use the data that is included with the project run the schema.sql in MySQL workbench.

To start the server and React-app run

```bash
npm start
```
or

```bash
npm start dev
```

This works thanks to Concurrently which allows React-app and the Node server to run at once in one terminal window.

The client folder has a proxy for localhost:4000 (the port the server is running on) so that you do not run into issues with CORS when using fetch to the server for the data. This also allows for http requests for the server can be used with React-app's localhost:3000.

To be able to use the MySQL connection you will need to create a .env file with your password for mySQL workbench. It should look like this:

```bash
MYPASSWORD='your password here'
```
