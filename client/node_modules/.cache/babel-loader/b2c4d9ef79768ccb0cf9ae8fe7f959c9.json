To pursue their dreams Skyler did not stop working on guitars, almost every second of their day was spent working on guitars at one point. They never stopped moving. This work ethic lent itself to the name Hummingbird Guitars. Hummingbird Guitars is perfect for anyone looking for a great deal. All of our products have been thoroughly inspected and set up by trained experts before they leave our shop. We also partner with the manufacturers for giveaways whenever possible so keep your eye on the site for those too! Our business is family owned and operated. The founders spent 5 years training with the world's top luthiers. There's no better place to shop!\")));\n}\n\nexport default Home;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/sabrinastevens/Documents/Ecommerce-III/client/src/Components/Home.jsx"],"names":["React","Slider","Home"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,MAAP,MAAmB,UAAnB;;AAEA,SAASC,IAAT,GAAgB;AACZ,SACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACA;AAAI,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,uCADA,EAGA,oBAAC,MAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IAHA,EAKA;AAAS,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,mCAAnB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACE;AAAI,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAd;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,iBADF,EAEE;AAAG,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,SAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,qtCAFF,CALA,CADA;AAeE;;AAEN,eAAeA,IAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\nimport Slider from './Slider'\n\nfunction Home() {\n    return (\n    <div>\n    <h1 className=\"text-center home-title\">Welcome to Hummingbird Guitars!</h1>\n\n    <Slider />     \n\n    <section className=\"container mt-3 mb-3 border-bottom\">\n      <h2 className=\"ml-5\">About Us:</h2>\n      <p className=\"about-p\">Hummingbird Guitars was founded in 2016 with a shared passion for quality guitars.
